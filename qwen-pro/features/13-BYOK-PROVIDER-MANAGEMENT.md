# Enhancement 13 – BYOK Custom Provider Management

## Objective
Provide a dedicated `/BYOK` command surface that keeps custom OpenAI-compatible provider configurations separate from the existing `/codeplan` work and lets users manage any provider (GLM, GPT-5, Ollama, etc.) backed by their own keys. The command should ship with a read-only provider list, provider detail & edit views, connectivity actions, and tooling to refresh cached models.

## Command Flow
1. **Entry point (`/BYOK` or `/byok`)**
   - Description: “Custom Providers” screen summarizing locally configured tokens/endpoints.
   - Columns: display name, provider kind, base URL, default model, cached model count, API key status.
   - Actions: select a provider, add a provider (+ option to close the screen).
   - UI sample (Ink-style menu):
     ```
     /BYOK — Custom Providers
     Manage custom OpenAI-compatible providers.

     › 1. Ollama (localhost)  Kind: Ollama • http://localhost:11434 • Default model: qwen2.5vl • Cached models: 9
       2. z.ai                Kind: OpenAI Responses • https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4 • Cached models: 3 • API key stored
       3. Add provider        Create a new custom provider entry
       4. Close
     ```

2. **Provider detail view**
   - Header: display name and provider ID (e.g., “Ollama (localhost) (ollama)”).
   - Meta rows: Kind, Base URL, default model, cached count, flag whether the API key is stored.
   - Menu actions:
     1. Edit provider (opens the form below).
     2. Refresh models (trigger a connectivity probe to list available models via the provider’s API).
     3. View cached models (show a scrollable list of cached IDs, mark the default selection).
     4. Delete provider (remove config + credentials after confirmation).
     5. Back (return to provider list).

3. **Edit provider form**
   - Title: `Edit provider (name)` and prompt: “Select a field to edit, then save.”
   - Editable fields / toggles:
     1. Display name – string label.
     2. Provider ID – slug used in `.qwen/settings.json` and CLI flags.
     3. Provider kind – cycle through supported provider types (e.g., Ollama, OpenAI Responses, OpenAI GPT-5, Custom HTTP, etc.).
     4. Vendor-specific toggles (e.g., `Ollama thinking`, `Post-process reasoning`).
     5. Helper tip for the provider (e.g., “run `ollama pull` before refreshing”).
     6. Base URL – accepts explicit value; `!clear` resets to the default entry.
     7. Default model – optional fallback used when the cached list is empty.
   - Save/cancel actions and validation for required fields (base URL, API key when needed).

## Persistence & Settings
- Entries live under `customProviders` in `~/.qwen/settings.json`, augmenting the existing `features/03-SETTINGS-AND-CONFIG.md` schema.
- Providers advertise the list of cached models, default selection, kind, and API key presence for display in `/BYOK`.
- Refresh models action should hit the provider’s capability (e.g., `/api/tags` for Ollama, `/model/list` for OpenAI) and update cached entries in `.qwen/custom/providers.json`. Failures produce friendly warnings.
- Delete provider clears both `settings.json` entry and any corresponding credentials stored via `/auth custom` (if applicable). Hitting “Refresh models” should also surface telemetry event `byok.models.refresh` with provider id.

## UX Notes
- Replace any existing `/codeplan` UI references in the bridge with this `/BYOK` command entry (the eventual CodePlan workflow should be invoked from the provider detail screen once the provider supports it).
- Provide keyboard navigation hints (1–5 menu choices) consistent with the Ink CLI’s select list handling.
- The command is considered enhancement 13 and lives under `features/13-BYOK-PROVIDER-MANAGEMENT.md` for discovery.

## Testing & Migration
- Add Vitest fixtures that simulate selecting a provider, running “Refresh models”, and editing properties; stub network calls using MSW or similar.
- Document the steps to import/export BYOK entries across machines (e.g., copying `~/.qwen/custom/providers.json`).
